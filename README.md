# Challenge 4: Coding-Quiz

## Challenge Description

This week’s Challenge invites us to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions that allows us to practice and apply the skills needed to complete a coding assessment, perhaps one that may be apart of an interview process. This app should run in the browser, and should feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that we are required to write. It should have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## Challenge Requirements

- Create a timed quiz using JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
- When the Webpage is loaded a Welcome page with a message, instructions, and a Start button is displayed
- When the user clicks on the start button then a timer starts and the user is presented with a question
- When the user answers a question then the a message is displayed whether the response was incorrect or correct and is then presented with another question
- When an question is answered incorrectly then the time is subtracted from the clock
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over
